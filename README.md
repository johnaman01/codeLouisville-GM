*RANOOK is a random encounter generator that can be used by GM's for table-top role playing games to create a random encounter in a pinch.
*RANOOK only generates descriptive text that the GM then adapts to whatever game system is being used.  
  *In other words, RANOOK as released is unable to generate mechanical data applicable to the randomly selected encounter.
*RANOOK ought to be a single page application, both simple to use and aesthetically pleasing.  
*It is best when incorporated into GM preparation of game sessions, either for ideas or as a tool to create a classic, random encounter table.
*RANOOK uses a database to store a catalog that can be modified by the user.  
  *It would be nice if the user could construct new objects in the catalog...incorporating specific game mechanics into a random encounter.
