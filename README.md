#**RANOOK is a random encounter generator that can be used by GM's or table-top role playing games to create a random encounter in a pinch.  RANOOK only generates descriptive text that the GM then adapts to whatever game system is being used.  In other words, RANOOK as released is unable to generate mechanical data applicable to the randomly selected encounter.
        RANOOK ought to be a single page application, both simple to use and aesthetically pleasing.  It is best when incorporated into GM preparation of game sessions, either for ideas or as a tool to create a classic, random encounter table.**#
